# Global Supply Chain: Optimizing for Costs Under Known Constraints
I design a linear programming (LP) algorithm to automate and streamline decision-making for a supply chain system for a major retailer that uses the services of five carriers. These carriers can ship containers across 290 Asia-U.S. routes. The retailer would like to have a software program that can determine which carrier should supply which route to minimize the costs of the whole operation. To develop the algorithm, I use PuLP, a linear programming modeler written in Python, to design an optimization algorithm used by an engineering team developing the software.
