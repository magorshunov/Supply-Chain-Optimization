# Global Supply Chain: Optimizing for Costs Under Known Constraints
I design a linear programming (LP) algorithm to automate and streamline decision-making for a supply chain system for a major US retailer that uses the services of five carriers. These carriers can ship containers across 290 Asia-U.S. routes. The retailer would like to have an interactive computer program that can be run to determine which carrier should supply which route to minimize the costs of the whole operation. To develop the algorithm, I use PuLP, a linear programming modeler written in Python.
